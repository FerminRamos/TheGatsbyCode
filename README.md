### Inspiration Behind the Code + Project's Intentions

On November 2020, I heard a podcast episode called, "The Bible Code". It detailed the story of a 
reporter named Michael Drosnin and his quest to find hidden meanings within Hebrew Scripture. 
According to Drosnin, his work has lead to the prediction of some of the world's biggest historical 
events. The podcast mentions how Drosnin had discovered events such as the Gulf War, the Great 
Depression, and the 1969 moon landing! I was skeptical at first, so I decided to investigate his
findings on my own. I, however, was not the first to do so. In fact, a research team experimented
with Drosnin's methodology on other religious scriptures and found similar results! Thus, it was 
concluded that Drosnin's experiments did ***not*** prove the superiority of the Hebrew Scripture. 
(It should be noted that the researchers did not discredit nor disrespect the Hebrew 
Scripture, and instead aimed to limit some of Michael Drosnin's faulty spiritual claims)

For most people, this was a happy ending to the whole debate. However, the researcher's conclusions 
left the door wide open for me. I was curious to know the extent of Drosnin's experiments and 
decided to take matters into my own hands. I wanted to know if ordinary library books, such as The 
Great Gatsby, could create prophecies as well? I decided to find the answer to my question by loosely
following Michael Drosnin's methodology. 

Creating meaningful predictions off of a book like The Great Gatsby was never the intention behind 
this code, which is why I didn't try to replicate Michael Drosnin's "Bible Code" exactly. Instead, 
this project was aimed as a parody towards Drosnin's unfounded religious claims. By showing how 
ordinary books are capable of producing similar data to religious texts, we can safely assume 
that all of Drosnin's predictions are based on statistical chance, rather than on religion.
